 abstract = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables a wealth of modern vehicular applications, such as pedestrian detection, real-time video analytics, etc., that can help to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. However, these applications impose significant resource demands on the in-vehicle resource-constrained Edge Computing (EC) device installation. In this article, we study the problem of resource-aware offloading of these computation-intensive applications to the Closest roadside units (RSUs) or telecommunication base stations (BSs), where on-site EC devices with larger resource capacities are deployed, and mobility of vehicles are considered at the same time. Specifically, we propose an Integrated EC framework, which can keep edge resources running across various in-vehicles, RSUs and BSs in a single pool, such that these resources can be holistically monitored from a single control plane (CP). Through the CP, individual in-vehicle, RSU or BS edge resource availability can be obtained, hence applications can be offloaded concerning their resource demands. This approach can avoid execution delays due to resource unavailability or insufficient resource availability at any EC deployment. This research further extends the state-of-the-art by providing intelligent multi-task scheduling, by considering both task dependencies and heterogeneous resource demands at the same time. To achieve this, we propose FedEdge, a variant Bin-Packing optimization approach through Gang-Scheduling of multi-dependent tasks that co-schedules and co-locates multi-task tightly on nodes to fully utilize available resources. Extensive experiments on real-world data trace from the recent Alibaba cluster trace, with information on task dependencies and resource demands, show the effectiveness, faster executions, and resource efficiency of our approach compared to the existing approaches.},
