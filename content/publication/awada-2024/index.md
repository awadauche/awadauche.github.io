abstract: Recently, several edge deployment types, such as on-premise edge clusters,
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-attached edge devices, telecommunication base stations
  installed with edge clusters, etc., are being deployed to enable faster response
  time for latency-sensitive tasks. One fundamental problem is where and how to offload
  and schedule multi-dependent tasks so as to minimize their collective execution
  time and to achieve high resource utilization. Existing approaches randomly dispatch
  tasks naively to available edge nodes without considering the resource demands of
  tasks, inter-dependencies of tasks and edge resource availability. These approaches
  can result in the longer waiting time for tasks due to insufficient resource availability
  or dependency support, as well as provider lock-in. Therefore, we present EdgeColla,
  which is based on the integration of edge resources running across multi-edge deployments.
  EdgeColla leverages learning techniques to intelligently dispatch multi-dependent
  tasks, and a variant bin-packing optimization method to co-locate these tasks firmly
  on available nodes to optimally utilize them. Extensive experiments on real-world
  datasets from Alibaba on task dependencies show that our approach can achieve optimal
  performance than the baseline schemes.
