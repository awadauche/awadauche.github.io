 abstract = {Recently, several edge deployment types, such as on-premise edge clusters, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-attached edge devices, telecommunication base stations installed with edge clusters, etc., are being deployed to enable faster response time for latency-sensitive tasks. One fundamental problem is where and how to offload and schedule multi-dependent tasks so as to minimize their collective execution time and to achieve high resource utilization. Existing approaches randomly dispatch tasks naively to available edge nodes without considering the resource demands of tasks, inter-dependencies of tasks and edge resource availability. These approaches can result in the longer waiting time for tasks due to insufficient resource availability or dependency support, as well as provider lock-in. Therefore, we present EdgeColla, which is based on the integration of edge resources running across multi-edge deployments. EdgeColla leverages learning techniques to intelligently dispatch multi-dependent tasks, and a variant bin-packing optimization method to co-locate these tasks firmly on available nodes to optimally utilize them. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Alibaba on task dependencies show that our approach can achieve optimal performance than the baseline schemes.},
