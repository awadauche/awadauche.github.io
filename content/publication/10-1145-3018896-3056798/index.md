abstract: 'Cloud computing providers have recently begun offering container instances,
  which provide an efficient route to application deployment within a lightweight,
  isolated and well-defined execution environment. Cloud providers currently offer
  Container Service Platforms (CSPs), which support the flexible orchestration of
  containerised applications.Existing CSP frameworks do not offer any form of intelligent
  resource scheduling: applications are usually scheduled individually, rather than
  taking a holistic view of all registered applications and available resources in
  the cloud. This can result in increased execution times for applications, resource
  wastage through underutilized container-instances, and a reduction in the number
  of applications that can be deployed, given the available resources.This paper presents
  a cloud-based Container Management Service (CMS) framework, which offers increased
  deployment density, scalability and resource efficiency for containerised applications.
  CMS extends the state-of-the-art by providing additional functionalities for orchestrating
  containerised applications by joint optimisation of sets of containerised applications
  and resource pool on the cloud. We evaluate CMS on a cloud-based CSP i.e., Amazon
  EC2 Container Management Service (ECS) and conducted extensive experiments using
  sets of CPU and Memory intensive containerised applications against the direct deployment
  strategy of Amazon ECS. The results show that CMS achieves up to 25% higher cluster
  utilisation and up to 2.5 times faster execution times.'
