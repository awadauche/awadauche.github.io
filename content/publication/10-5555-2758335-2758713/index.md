abstract: Efficient application processing is critical for achieving high performance
  in heterogeneous computing systems, i.e., Optimal System configuration and load
  distribution of some given types of applications, such that the average response
  time of tasks is minimized. Such performance optimization is important for a cloud
  computing provider to efficiently utilize all the available resources and to deliver
  the highest quality of service. To achieve this, first we use clustering algorithm
  to group the tasks into distinct classes with similar characteristics in terms of
  resource and performance requirements. Second, a multicore server processor is treated
  as a group of queuing systems with multiple servers, i.e., M/M/m queuing systems.
  Third, we formulate and solve the optimal load distribution of tasks and the problem
  of optimal multicore server processing partitioning for multiple heterogeneous multicore
  servers. We show that although the problem is sophisticated, it can be solved by
  a numerical algorithm. We obtain not only detailed assessment of cloud center performance,
  but also insights into equilibrium arrangement, and power consumption to be kept
  under control.
