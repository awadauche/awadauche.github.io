abstract: ' With the rapid growth of emerging applications like social network, semantic
  web, sensor networks and LBS (Location Based Service) applications, a variety of
  data to be processed continues to witness a quick increase. Effective management
  and processing of large-scale data poses an interesting but critical challenge.
  Recently, big data has attracted a lot of attention from academia, industry as well
  as government. This paper introduces several big data processing techniques from
  system and application aspects. First, from the view of cloud data management and
  big data processing mechanisms, we present the key issues of big data processing,
  including definition of big data, big data management platform, big data service
  models, distributed file system, data storage, data virtualization platform and
  distributed applications. Following the MapReduce parallel processing framework,
  we introduce some MapReduce optimization strategies reported in the literature.
  Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges, and deeply explore the research
  directions in the future on big data processing in cloud computing environments. '
