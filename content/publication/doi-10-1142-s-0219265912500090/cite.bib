 abstract = { With the rapid growth of emerging applications like social network, semantic web, sensor networks and LBS (Location Based Service) applications, a variety of data to be processed continues to witness a quick increase. Effective management and processing of large-scale data poses an interesting but critical challenge. Recently, big data has attracted a lot of attention from academia, industry as well as government. This paper introduces several big data processing techniques from system and application aspects. First, from the view of cloud data management and big data processing mechanisms, we present the key issues of big data processing, including definition of big data, big data management platform, big data service models, distributed file system, data storage, data virtualization platform and distributed applications. Following the MapReduce parallel processing framework, we introduce some MapReduce optimization strategies reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges, and deeply explore the research directions in the future on big data processing in cloud computing environments. },
